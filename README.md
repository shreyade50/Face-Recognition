# Face-Recognition
* Differentiate between face recognition and face verification
* Implement one-shot learning to solve a face recognition problem
* Apply the triplet loss function to learn a network's parameters in the context of face recognition
*Explain how to pose face recognition as a binary classification problem
* Map face images into 128-dimensional encodings using a pretrained model
* Perform face verification and face recognition with these encodings
